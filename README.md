# Cannabis-Predictions

This project was aimed at classifying strains of cannabis by their race (indica, sativa, or hybrid) using various attributes associated to the plant. Data regarding race, taste, and effects was gathered from The Strain API, along with webscraped information from WikiLeaf for the thc/cbd contents, and more strains and their thc contents were accessed from CSVs originally from the Kushy API. After running various models and balancing the classes using SMOTE, I was to achieve an accuracy of 70.4% in classification with Logistic Regression.
